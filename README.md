# Introduction

Hello Team,

My name is Enest Dembedza, and I hail from the beautiful city of Harare in Zimbabwe. I am genuinely thrilled to be a part of this incredible team and to have the opportunity to collaborate with each one of you.

# Personal Information

On the personal front, I am a proud husband and a father of two wonderful kids. My family holds a special place in my heart, and I wake up every day with the goal of bringing smiles to their faces.

# Hobbies

In my leisure time, I have a deep appreciation for outdoor activities, particularly hiking and fishing. There's an undeniable serenity that comes with immersing oneself in the embrace of nature, and I find it truly revitalizing. Hiking, in particular, helps me clear my mind and relish the present moment. On the other hand, fishing offers a delightful way to bond with friends and family while basking in the beauty of the great outdoors.

Thank you for taking a moment to learn a bit about me. I'm eagerly looking forward to not only working together but also getting to know each of you better as we join forces to accomplish our shared goals.
